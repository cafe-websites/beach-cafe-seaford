name: Beach Cafe Seaford
description: Perched among the dunes overlooking the beach, Beach Cafe Seaford is just the place to meet friends and family. The tantalising dishes for breakfast and lunch include both vegan and gluten free options, and the vast selection of cakes are to die for. Relax either inside or out on the deck overlooking the bay, or grab a take away and explore the beach and the foreshore... and the dolphins are free.
